INSTRUCTIONS: 
Replace the contents of src/App.js with your complete React component code.

The file should start with:
import React, { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState, useCallback } from "react";
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js";

And end with:
export default function CoordinationGeometryAnalyzer() { ... }

Copy your complete component code from your original message and paste it into src/App.js
