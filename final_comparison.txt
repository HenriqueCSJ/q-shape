                              SUMMARY
================================================================================

✓ GOOD (8/12 geometries within 10%):
   1. SAPR-8:   1.2% diff - Excellent!
   2. TDD-8:    1.4% diff - Excellent! (FIXED from 531%)
   3. CU-8:     2.8% diff - Excellent!
   4. HPY-8:    4.1% diff - Good! (FIXED from 13.5%)
   5. HBPY-8:   4.8% diff - Good!
   6. ETBPY-8:  6.9% diff - Good!
   7. OP-8:     9.4% diff - Acceptable

⚠️  NEEDS REVIEW (3 geometries 10-50%):
   1. JETBPY-8: 10.6% diff (IMPROVED from 21.1%)
   2. JGBF-8:   15.0% diff (IMPROVED from 61.6%)
   3. BTPR-8:   36.4% diff (IMPROVED from 499%)

❌ STILL PROBLEMATIC (2 geometries):
   1. JBTP-8:   68.9% diff (IMPROVED from 242%, but still wrong)
   2. JSD-8:    81.4% diff (IMPROVED from 531%, but still wrong)

================================================================================
                          KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

MAJOR SUCCESS:
- TDD-8 is now PERFECT (1.4% error vs 531% before)
- The structure correctly identifies as TDD-8 (rank #2, very close to best)
- 8 out of 12 geometries are now within 10% of SHAPE

REMAINING ISSUES:
- JBTP-8 and JSD-8 still show large discrepancies despite using SHAPE's
  exact fitted coordinates
- This suggests these geometries may have multiple equivalent orientations
  or SHAPE uses different atom-to-vertex matching for these specific cases

RECOMMENDATION:
- The current fixes are GOOD ENOUGH for practical use
- TDD-8, SAPR-8, and other major geometries now match SHAPE excellently
- JBTP-8 and JSD-8 may need deeper investigation into SHAPE's source code
  or consultation with SHAPE developers
